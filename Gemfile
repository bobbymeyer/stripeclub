# Pandatone is not published to RubyGems; the engine takes it from the
# default branch of its repository rather than from a tag. A tag cannot
# exist until the change that needs it has merged, and this Gemfile is only
# what the dummy under test/ runs on — what a host resolves is the gemspec,
# which asks for a version. Running the suite against Pandatone's tip is the
# point: a break between the two shows up here rather than in a host.
# its-swiss comes from RubyGems through the gemspec.

# json 3.0.0 (7 September 2026) changed the signature of JSON.parse, and Active
# Support 8.1.3.1 still calls it the old way: a signed cookie, a JSON column, a
# schema load all raise. The lock is not committed here, so CI resolves the
# newest json. Below 3 until a Rails that takes it; the gem does not depend on it.
